# Locations

### Lia's Apartment

### Will's Office

Fancily decorated, like a 60 yo businessman would (dark, heavy wood, lots of unnecessary padding, gold shit everywhere). It's in an office building, and the office space itself is split into two rooms off of a hallway. The anteroom is small, tall ceiling, with a heavy secretary's desk in the corner. The office room itself has a back wall of tall windows that look more ominous than inviting (like the doors, har har)

### Portal Room

In the back room of a bar. The room is cave-like, with tall stone walls, and maybe 15 ft to the opposite side of the room (so small floor space)? There's an invisible portal halfway across the room that's like a one-way mirror: from the bar side you can't see it and it masks the door on the other side; on the action side you can see a faint gold line from where the portal touches the floor, ceiling, walls, and you can see the bar door. It's often dank, cold, and stale in there. On the action side, there's a light smell of sulfur.

Action door is made out of wood, with black peeling paint and a tarnished gold-colored doornob. There's a peep... door? in it that can slide across from the other side (like in Roger Rabbit)
