# 1st Readthrough Notes

### Pg 1

need perhaps a different intro scene? Story is supernatural/fantastic, might as well let it open up that way.

"They were open, but not invitingly so"--like

"windows marched around the exterior of the office like a wall"--don't like.... what?? "windows were like a wall", what was I thinking

Erm... dialogue... I guess... kind of snappy? Lia is very presumptuous, arrogant here.

### Pg. 2

They're flirting

She gets hired reeallly quickly. But I guess I didn't want to spend a whole lot of time writing an interview. 

"use and abuse", Will. Don't let the door kick you on the way out!

### Pg. 3

"Dear". Will's an ass

Thirteen secretaries. That seems a tad... high, maybe. But it's trying to make a point, but... okay, kind of hyperbolic

I like that he doesn't make any move to help her, just tosses her into the fire. Brings her down a couple of notches. I don't know if that's completely necessary, though

### Pg. 4

Notes page: Lia's background changes from middle class to homeless, if I remember correctly

God these paragraphs are so effin sloppy. Rewrite everything dealing with the passwords... somehow

### Pg. 5

Ugh, the Will wanting coffee thing is so... awful. Don't we have the point rammed in our heads hard enough already?

### Pg. 6

Writing could use some tightening, but nothing's super "off"

### Pg. 7

Ew, Lia, stop whining so much. You can talk to your cat, though. Killing yourself is kind of dramatic, though.


### Pg. 8

Okay. So. This whole scene doesn't really work, because, like, why would Will blame her for the explosion? Why would he insta-fire her? Why would she go and investigate? Makes no sense whatsoever. Drop, rewrite, whatever.

Maybe change it so that the explosion happens while she's out getting coffee and he was in the bathroom or something? Didi waits until he leaves so that he doesn't get in the way--something like that. Don't let Lia head home for chrissakes!

### Pg. 9

Whine whine bitch bitch Will. Good christ. Re-write and/or drop. Wrangle in Will's complete psycho-cism just a bit.

God, he's like a fucking child!

"A flame throwing" lulz speed-writing

### Pg. 10

I like Will throwing a tantrum (and shit out the window) and bossing Lia around, though of course the firing/re-hiring "now do what i want" thing if rather obnoxious and should be cut

### Pg. 11

I like that Will realizes that it might be his previous secretary a la the password notebook, but he replies by acting like a stupid little child
